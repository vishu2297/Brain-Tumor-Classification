# Brain-Tumor-Classification
 
In this machine learning project, we build a classifier to detect the brain tumor (if any) from the MRI scan images. By now it is evident that this is a binary classification problem. Examples of such binary classification problems are Spam or Not spam, Credit card fraud (Fraud or Not fraud).
 
### Summary
In brain tumor classification using machine learning, we built a binary classifier to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images. We built our classifier using transfer learning and obtained an accuracy of 92.31% and visualized our modelâ€™s overall performance.
